# Plant-GEMs : Projects that aims to the reconstruction of several plants metabolic networks.

-- Python files --

blasting.py : Creation of plant draft model from a template model.

blastingTK.py : GUI of blasting.py (work in progress).

fusion.py : Merge two metabolic networks, one from a Metacyc reconstruction with Pathway Tools (cf. pathwayToolsPrep.py) and the other one from an homemade script which is reconstructed based on an already curated model (cf. blasting.py).

gap_filling.py : Performs a gap filling of the model with Meneco. (Work In Progress).

graph.py : Utilitary file to create different graphs and statistical analysis.

pathwayToolsPrep.py : Preparation of files to run Pathway Tools automatically and create a draft based on Metacyc.

utils.py : Utilitary file to avoid code repetition.

-- R files --

R/graph.R : Make different graphs for the purpose of a study on the Balst scores to use.

R/regression.R : Regression graph for the same purpose as above.

R/tresholdSearch.R : Research of a treshold value for the score chosen above.
