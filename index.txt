- First line is the path of the main directory where you're supposed to have:
    dir : /files
        --> containing all the files for each organism you build (fasta + gff + tsv annotations from EggNog).
    dir : /initialisation
        --> containing one .ini file for each organism.
- All the other lines are the path and name for each .ini file (in a future update : automatic read of those filenames).
